# A Short Exercise to Explore Object-Oriented Programming - Encapsulation

---
## Overview

This repository is a short exercise designed for you to explore **Encapsulation** which is one of the
four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---
## üìñ Instructions

- Fork this repository
  

- To run the program, go to the [Main](src/main/java/com/techreturners/encapsulation/bankaccount/app/Main.java) class which 
  is the entry point and run it using IntelliJ
  

- There are two models `DodgyBankAccount` and `SecureBankAccount`, these are located in the 
  [model](src/main/java/com/techreturners/encapsulation/bankaccount/model) directory.

## ü§ì Study Prompts

Use the following questions to guide your exploration and learning! üó∫

- Run the `main` method on the `Main` class, what is it doing? What is being outputted to the console?

--- DODGY BANK ACCOUNT ---

Mmm...I spot a dodgy bank account! Let's make one!
What is my current balance?
Your account balance is 0
Let's deposit an amount of 30
Your account balance is 80
Wow! Looks like we get a reward of 50 when we deposit an amount
Let's be naughty and add rewards without depositing!
Your account balance is 230
Wow! We're rich!
Let's make a lot of money right now! Let's change the account balance directly!
Your account balance is 1000000
? Weeeeee!!!!

--- SECURE BANK ACCOUNT ---

Mmm...let's make a secure bank account!
What is my current balance?
Your account balance is 0
Let's deposit an amount of 30
Your account balance is 80
Wow! Looks like we get a reward of 50 when we deposit an amount
Let's be naughty and add rewards without depositing!
Oh no :( It looks like we can't do this - it's too secure!
Your account balance is 80
Let's make a lot of money right now! Let's change the account balance directly!
Oh no :( It looks like we can't do this - it's too secure!
Your account balance is 80
? Well I guess that's secure!


- Look at the `DodgyBankAccount`, this class is not well-encapsulated.
  Can you note down the problems with how the class is designed, and the ways it is being misused?
  
  The main problem is class attributes and methods are public, which means they can be accessed from outside the class and can be misused to make changes.  
   
  - Compare and contrast the `DodgyBankAccount` and the `SecureBankAccount`, how is the `SecureBankAccount` different to 
  the `DodgyBankAccount`? How is it designed to prevent it from being misused? Are there instances of better method names
    for clearer abstraction?

    1.The method addRewards() is made private in SecureBankAccount because it is not meant to be called directly outside the classes.
     That method is used to implement the main Logic, so if it should not be exposed and misused. 
    2. By making the property REWARDAMOUNT a constant and private, it cannot be edited further and reduces redundancy.

## üê∏ Extension Challenge

- Now that you've had the chance to explore a well-encapsulated vs. poorly-encapsulated class,
your next challenge is to put your newly minted skills into practice üí™!
  
- Refactor the `WeatherReporter` class located in the [model](src/main/java/com/techreturners/encapsulation/bankaccount/model) directory.
  
- You may want to think about Encapsulation here. Do the methods follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)? Are the method names suitable?
  Are there any magic numbers / hardcoded numbers in the code that needs to be represented by a constant?
  Are there better ways to write the code?
  
- As an added challenge, could you write some unit tests to test the class' methods?
